# Working-with-Data-in-Python

You work as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company launched in Chicago.

In addition to the data you obtained in the previous task, you have been given a second file. Now, you have two CSV files as follows: /datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv - containing the following data:

company_name: name of the taxi company
trips_amount: number of trips for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017.
/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv - containing the following data: dropoff_location_name:

neighborhood names in Chicago where trips ended
average_trips: average number of trips ending in each neighborhood in November 2017.

Objective
The goal of this project is as follows:

To scrape data from a website
Creating data slices
Grouping data
Properly combining data
Formulating hypotheses
Testing hypotheses

Work Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis Stage (Python)
Importing both files
Studying the contents of the data
Ensuring the data types are correct
Identifying the top 10 neighborhoods used as drop-off points
Creating graphs: taxi companies and their trip counts, top 10 neighborhoods by drop-off count
Drawing conclusions based on the created graphs and explaining the results

Hypothesis Testing Stage (Python)
Formulating the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
Criteria used for testing the hypothesis and reasons for using them
